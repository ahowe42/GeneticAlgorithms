# Optimization with Genetic Algorithms

This repository holds code and demonstrative notebooks for optimization with genetic algorithms (GA). Much of this code is adapted from something I originally wrote in MATLAB back in 2007 or so. Use of the GA is demonstrated for three types of optimization problems.

## Machine Learning Feature Selection

## Real-valued Optimization - Distribution Fitting

## Real-valued Optimization - Multivariate Function Minimization
